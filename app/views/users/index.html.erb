    We can render user (for the _user.htm.erb file)
    Rails infers that @users is a list of User objects.
    when called with a collection of users, Rails automaticaly
    iterates through them and renders each one with the
    _user.html.erb partial

    inferring the name of the partial from the name of the
    class.
